<h1 align="center">Hi ğŸ‘‹, I'm Eren ERBEK</h1>
<h3 align="center">A passionate backend developer from Turkey</h3>
<p A graduate in computer programming, currently pursuing my journey to become a software engineer at Ecole 42. My passion for coding and curiosity drives my constant desire to learn new languages and technologies.

I see coding as an art, and every new project is a reflection of my creative thinking and problem-solving skills. I enjoy working both individually and in teams, as I believe that combining different perspectives can lead to superior outcomes.

I have a keen interest in algorithms, data structures, and software design. Simultaneously, I'm gaining experience in frontend and backend development. I strive to write code that is clean, readable, and aims to create user-friendly and effective solutions.

On my GitHub profile, you'll find a variety of projects where I apply new languages and technologies I've learned. You're welcome to join me on this journey by following my progress or contributing to my projects. Additionally, I share updates about the latest happenings in the software world and my experiences through my blog.

I'm always open to learning and growing. Feel free to reach out; I'm excited about exchanging ideas, collaborating on new projects, and coding together</p>
